Remote Repository:
  - A remote repository is a Git repository hosted on a remote server or a code hosting platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
  - It acts as a centralized location for collaborating changes from multiple developers, where multiple developers can push and pull     changes to keep the repository in sync.
  - We can not do any changes directly to remote repository and a valid user with proper access can push changes to remote repo from only local repo.

Local Repository:
  - A local repository is a copy of a Git repository that resides on your local machine.
  - It contains the complete copy of the repo repository, including all branches, commits, and files etc.
  - The local repository allows you to make changes, commit them, switch between branches, and perform Git operations without needing a live network connection to remote repo.
  - You can create a local repository by initializing a new repository with git init or cloning an existing repository using git clone.
  
  #To get a local repo / to download / clone a remote repo 
      git clone <url_of_the_remote_repository>

git status 
  - The git status is used to display the current status of your Git repository.
  - shows information about which files have been modified, which files are staged for the next commit, and which files are untracked.

git log 
  - git log is used to view all commits history of a Git repository.
  - It displays list of commits starting from the most recent commit on top.
  - The commit history provides essential information about the changes made to the repository such as, 
      commit messages, authors, dates, and unique identifiers (commit hash/id).

git add 
  - Adds changes to the staging area. 
  - This is where you can review your changes before committing them to your local repository.
  # Add all changes to the staging area
    git add .   (OR)   git add --all
    
    git add -A is equivalent to git add --all
    git add -u is equivalent to git add --update
    
    NOTE: Extra information just in case if you want to try but not required
    Command	        New-Files	    Modified-Files	Deleted-Files	        Description
      git add -A	     YES	            YES	          YES	                Stage all (new, modified, deleted) files
      git add .	     YES	            YES	          YES	                Stage all (new, modified, deleted) files in current folder
      git add -u	      NO	            YES	          YES	                Stage modified and deleted files only
        
git commit 
  - Create a new commit containing the current changes of the stagging area (added files and directories)
  - We need to give a commit message which we can see in the git log message describing the changes.
  
  # Commit the changes with a message
      git commit -m "Added new feature"
      
git push 
  - git push is a command used to push your local commited changes (after git add and git commit) to a remote repository.
  - When you make changes to your local repository and want to share them with others or synchronize them with a remote repository 
    (such as on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), you use git push to send those changes to the remote repository.
  
git pull 
  - git pull is a command used to fetch and merge changes from a remote repository into your local repository.
  - When others pushed changes to the remote repository, you can use git pull to update your local repository to get new commits from remopte repository.

git merge vs rebase 

Both git merge and rebase are used to combines the changes from one branch into another branch but different approaches to integrating changes from one branch into another in Git

merge 
   - Merge creates a new commit which shows the changes combined from both branches. 
   - Merge preserves the history of both branches, so you can see which changes came from which branch.
   - Merge can sometimes create merge conflicts, we need to discuss with the developers and solve the merge conflicts to complete the merge.
     (usually merge conflicts occurs if 2 different users try the chagne the same lines in the same file and if we try to merge it)
   
rebase 
   - Rebase do not creates a new commit that combines the changes from both branches. 
   - Rebase rewrites the history of the first branch, it will bring all the commits from source branch and place it to the tip of 
     the destination branch. (Commit history usually will become a linear and cleaner tree)
   - Rebases do not create merge conflicts, but they can make it difficult to track the history of your repository.
